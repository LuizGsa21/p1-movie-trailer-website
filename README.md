The Movie Trailer Website project uses python to generate a list of movie tiles, along with its respective box art imagery and movie trailer.

# Overview
`app.py` creates a list of movies from `movies.json` and saves the generated web page to `index.html`. To view a live demo click  [here](http://luizgsa21.github.io/p1-movie-trailer-website/).
